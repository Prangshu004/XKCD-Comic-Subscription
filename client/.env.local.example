# Client Environment Variables Setup Guide

## For Local Development
Create a `.env.local` file in the client directory:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## For Vercel Deployment
Do NOT create a .env file in the client directory. 
Instead, set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add the following:
   - `VITE_BACKEND_URL` = your Railway backend URL (e.g., https://your-app.up.railway.app)

## Important Security Note
Never commit a .env file with actual values to the repository as it could expose sensitive information. Environment variables in client-side code are visible to users, so only use public URLs/configurations.
